SMS-based generative music.

We implement a NodeJS-based server with three modes:
1. /gate - SMS gateway
2. /poll - returns map {phone#: msg}
3. /change - long-polling API returning map whenever there is a change

Additionally, a (trivial) synthesizer that subscribes to and sonifies
changes is implemented, audio.numm.py.
